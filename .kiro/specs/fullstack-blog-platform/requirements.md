# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WriterFlow platform is a full-stack blog application similar to Medium, designed to provide a beautiful and intuitive interface for writers of all backgrounds to create, publish, and share their content. The platform leverages Next.js for optimal performance and SEO, with a focus on creating a seamless writing experience through a rich text editor. The frontend UI is already built, and this specification focuses on implementing the backend functionality, user authentication, database integration with Turso DB using Drizzle ORM, and creating a rich text editor for content creation.
